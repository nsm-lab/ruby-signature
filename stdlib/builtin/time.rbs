# [Time](Time) is an abstraction of dates and times.
# [Time](Time) is stored internally as the number of
# seconds with fraction since the *Epoch* , January 1, 1970 00:00 UTC.
# Also see the library module Date. The [Time](Time)
# class treats GMT (Greenwich Mean [Time](Time) ) and
# UTC (Coordinated Universal [Time](Time) ) as
# equivalent. GMT is the older way of referring to these baseline times
# but persists in the names of calls on POSIX systems.
# 
# All times may have fraction. Be aware of this fact when comparing times
# with each other – times that are apparently equal when displayed may be
# different when compared.
# 
# Since Ruby 1.9.2, [Time](Time) implementation uses a
# signed 63 bit integer, Bignum or
# [Rational](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Rational.html). The integer
# is a number of nanoseconds since the *Epoch* which can represent
# 1823-11-12 to 2116-02-20. When Bignum or
# [Rational](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Rational.html) is used
# (before 1823, after 2116, under nanosecond),
# [Time](Time) works slower as when integer is used.
# 
# 
# All of these examples were done using the EST timezone which is GMT-5.
# 
# 
# You can create a new instance of [Time](Time) with
# [::new](Time#method-c-new). This will use the
# current system time. [::now](Time#method-c-now) is
# an alias for this. You can also pass parts of the time to
# [::new](Time#method-c-new) such as year, month,
# minute, etc. When you want to construct a time this way you must pass at
# least a year. If you pass the year with nothing else time will default
# to January 1 of that year at 00:00:00 with the current system timezone.
# Here are some examples:
# 
# ```ruby
# Time.new(2002)         #=> 2002-01-01 00:00:00 -0500
# Time.new(2002, 10)     #=> 2002-10-01 00:00:00 -0500
# Time.new(2002, 10, 31) #=> 2002-10-31 00:00:00 -0500
# ```
# 
# You can pass a UTC offset:
# 
# ```ruby
# Time.new(2002, 10, 31, 2, 2, 2, "+02:00") #=> 2002-10-31 02:02:02 +0200
# ```
# 
# Or a timezone object:
# 
# ```ruby
# tz = timezone("Europe/Athens") # Eastern European Time, UTC+2
# Time.new(2002, 10, 31, 2, 2, 2, tz) #=> 2002-10-31 02:02:02 +0200
# ```
# 
# You can also use [::gm](Time#method-c-gm),
# [::local](Time#method-c-local) and
# [::utc](Time#method-c-utc) to infer GMT, local and
# UTC timezones instead of using the current system setting.
# 
# You can also create a new time using
# [::at](Time#method-c-at) which takes the number of
# seconds (or fraction of seconds) since the [Unix
# Epoch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).
# 
# ```ruby
# Time.at(628232400) #=> 1989-11-28 00:00:00 -0500
# ```
# 
# 
# Once you have an instance of [Time](Time) there is a
# multitude of things you can do with it. Below are some examples. For all
# of the following examples, we will work on the assumption that you have
# done the following:
# 
# ```ruby
# t = Time.new(1993, 02, 24, 12, 0, 0, "+09:00")
# ```
# 
# Was that a monday?
# 
# ```ruby
# t.monday? #=> false
# ```
# 
# What year was that again?
# 
# ```ruby
# t.year #=> 1993
# ```
# 
# Was it daylight savings at the time?
# 
# ```ruby
# t.dst? #=> false
# ```
# 
# What’s the day a year later?
# 
# ```ruby
# t + (60*60*24*365) #=> 1994-02-24 12:00:00 +0900
# ```
# 
# How many seconds was that since the Unix Epoch?
# 
# ```ruby
# t.to_i #=> 730522800
# ```
# 
# You can also do standard functions like compare two times.
# 
# ```ruby
# t1 = Time.new(2010)
# t2 = Time.new(2011)
# 
# t1 == t2 #=> false
# t1 == t1 #=> true
# t1 <  t2 #=> true
# t1 >  t2 #=> false
# 
# Time.new(2010,10,31).between?(t1, t2) #=> true
# ```
# 
# 
# A timezone argument must have `local_to_utc` and `utc_to_local` methods,
# and may have `name` and `abbr` methods.
# 
# The `local_to_utc` method should convert a Time-like object from the
# timezone to UTC, and `utc_to_local` is the opposite. The result also
# should be a [Time](Time) or Time-like object (not
# necessary to be the same class). The
# [zone](Time#method-i-zone) of the result is just
# ignored. Time-like argument to these methods is similar to a
# [Time](Time) object in UTC without sub-second; it
# has attribute readers for the parts, e.g.
# [year](Time#method-i-year),
# [month](Time#method-i-month), and so on, and epoch
# time readers, [to\_i](Time#method-i-to_i). The
# sub-second attributes are fixed as 0, and
# [utc\_offset](Time#method-i-utc_offset),
# [zone](Time#method-i-zone),
# [isdst](Time#method-i-isdst), and their aliases are
# same as a [Time](Time) object in UTC. Also to\_time,
# \#+, and \#- methods are defined.
# 
# The `name` method is used for marshaling. If this method is not defined
# on a timezone object, [Time](Time) objects using
# that timezone object can not be dumped by
# [Marshal](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Marshal.html).
# 
# The `abbr` method is used by ‘%Z’ in
# [strftime](Time#method-i-strftime).
# 
# 
# At loading marshaled data, a timezone name will be converted to a
# timezone object by `find_timezone` class method, if the method is
# defined.
# 
# Similary, that class method will be called when a timezone argument does
# not have the necessary methods mentioned above.
